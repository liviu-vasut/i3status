# configuration file for i3status.sh

# you can define functions for conditionally coloring items by writing them here and then referencing their names instead of a color
# each of these functions will be called with an argument, the text of the item, and should return a color name or "default"
# for example, we define this function:
# function day_or_night(){
# 	# assuming the input is something like "10:25 AM" or "02:43 PM" this will return white for AM and black for PM hours
# 	[[ "$1" =~ "AM" ]] && echo "#ffffff" || echo "#000000";
# }
# then we use it for color
# color "clock" "day_or_night"

# set colors for each item in order from left to right
# colors are #RGB, #RRGGBB, 'default' or a function (see above)
# items not present in this list will be appended to the left of the status bar with the default color
color "project" "default";
color "task" "#00ff00";
color "time" "#cccccc";
color "state" "stateColor";
color "clock" "default";


# set which item will trigger an update of the status bar
# if "all" is set the status bar is updated on any item change
# this allows sending changes in one batch and only update once

#renderOn "all";
renderOn "clock";
renderOn "state";
